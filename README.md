# CodeCrafters challenge: build your own shell

This is a blog about the CodeCrafters build your own shell challenge. I will be tackling this challenge in Rust: most (if not all) of my programming experience has been in Python, and I'm eager to learn a second language. After doing some research, I chose Rust as the language for this challenge and subsequent challenges as well.
