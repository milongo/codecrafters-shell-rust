# CodeCrafters challenge: build your own shell

This is a blog about the [CodeCrafters build your own shell challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/introduction). I will be tackling this challenge in Rust: most (if not all) of my programming experience has been in Python, and I'm eager to learn a second language. After doing some research into programming languages, their features, popularity, ease of learning, I chose Rust as the language I'd like to dive into and learn.
